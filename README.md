## Usage
Insert any number with length 1-30 digits plus 1-2 digits separated by 'dot' for tenths and hundredths (optionally), e.g. 20 or 20.99 and click _Let convert_. To clear both input fields choose _Clear fields_.

## Architecture
The conversion provides class _NWConv_:

app \ Custom \ [NWConv.php](https://github.com/wie1900/conv/blob/main/app/Custom/NWConv.php)

The length of the input number can be extended by adding new values in the _$names_ array and changing validating rule in the controller to the appropriate value (currently: 30).

## Tests
The application has been tested using PHPUnit tests:
